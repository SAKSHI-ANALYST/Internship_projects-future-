This project analyzes datasets using Python with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. We cleaned the Titanic dataset by removing null values and outliers, calculated summary statistics, and focused on species classification in the Iris dataset. Clear visualizations helped uncover key patterns and relationships in the data.
